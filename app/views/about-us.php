        We are a local charity that finds new loving, families for pets after their owners have died.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are based in a small centre where the pets get a new forever home. We currently accept dogs and
        cats. But with your help, we want to include rodents, reptiles and fish. Unfortunately, we are lacking
        facilities for these animals. However, donations to support this goal are greatly appreciated.
      </p>
      <h2>Who we are</h2>
      <p>
        The centre is run by unpaid volunteers, including local vets, students, and community members.
      </p>
